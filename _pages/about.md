**Bio:** &nbsp; I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.cs.ucf.edu).

I recently earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas, where I was advised by [Prof. Tien N. Nguyen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/research.html). My research broadly lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering (SE). In particular, I explore if/how large language models understand and reason about program behaviors. More recently, I am interested in quantifying such understanding capabilities, and training the next generation of code reasoning models to optimize software development processes. My work has been recognized by the community with multiple accolades, including the *ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award* and the *IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper Award*.

**Prospective Students:** &nbsp; I am actively looking for brilliant students with a strong foundation and interest in programming languages, software engineering, and/or AI to join my research group, **SAIL@UCF** (**S**oftware Engineering and **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **L**ab, webpage coming shortly). We are ranked **[#15 in Software Engineering](https://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us)** on CSRankings (a metrics-based ranking of top CS institutions). 

Feel free to reach out with a copy of your CV and background: *aashish [dot] yadavally [at] ucf [dot] edu*

**Research Interests (TL;DR):** &nbsp; AI for Software Engineering, Software Security, Software Maintenance, Large Reasoning Models for Source Code
