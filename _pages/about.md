Let me quickly introduce myself: my name is **Aashish Yadavally**, first name pronounced  /	ɑ:ʃi:ʃ /.

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). With [Dr. Tien N. Nguyen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/research.html) as my research advisor, I am curently exploring problems at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, specifically to enable *analysis of partial programs* for improving security of software systems.

Prior to joining UTD, I graduated with an M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Georgia, and a B.Tech. degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Vadodara. Through my academic journey, I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of/with wonderful people and researchers in: 
<br/> &nbsp; [Dr. David Shaohua Wang](https://davidshaohuawang.wordpress.com/) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Informatics, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).
<br/> &nbsp; [Dr. Frederick Maier](https://csci.franklin.uga.edu/directory/people/fred-maier) is the Associate Director of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, University of Georgia (UGA).
<br/> &nbsp; [Dr. Hemant Patil](https://sites.google.com/site/hemantpatildaiict/) heads the Speech Research Lab, and is a Professor at the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute for Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT).

**You may see me at the following Conferences or Events**
<br/> &nbsp; 2023 ESEC/FSE (San Francisco, CA, USA), ICSE (Melbourne, Australia)
<br/> &nbsp; 2022 ASE (Detroit, MI, USA), ICSE (Pittsburgh, PA, USA), SANER (Virtual)

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
