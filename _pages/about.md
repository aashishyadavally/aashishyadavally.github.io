**[Bio]** I will be joining the [University of Central Florida](https://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor starting Fall 2025. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, advised by [Prof. Tien N. Nguyen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/research.html).

**[Prospective Students]** I am actively looking for brilliant students with a strong foundation and interest in programming languages, compilers, software engineering, and/or AI to join my research group, **SAIL@UCF** (**S**oftware Engineering and **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence Research **L**ab, webpage coming shortly). Feel free to reach out with a copy of your CV and background, via email: aashish [dot] yadavally [at] ucf [dot] edu

**[Research Interests]** My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering (SE). I explore if/how large language models understand and reason about program behaviors. Most recently, I am interested in quantifying such understanding capabilities, and training the next-generation of code reasoning models to optimize software development processes. My work has been recognized by the community with multiple accolades, including the *ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award* at FSE 2024, the *IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper Award* at SANER 2022, and a nomination at ICSE 2023. 

**You can find me at the following Conferences or Events**
<br/> &nbsp; 2024 &nbsp; OOPSLA (Pasadena, CA, USA), FSE (Porto de Galinhas, Brazil)
<br/> &nbsp; 2023 &nbsp; ESEC/FSE (San Francisco, CA, USA), ICSE (Melbourne, Australia)
<br/> &nbsp; 2022 &nbsp; ASE (Detroit, MI, USA), ICSE (Pittsburgh, PA, USA), SANER (Virtual)
