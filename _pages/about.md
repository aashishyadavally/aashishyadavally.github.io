Let me quickly introduce myself: my name is **Aashish Yadavally**, first name pronounced  /	ɑ:ʃi:ʃ /.

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. With [Dr. Tien N. Nguyen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/research.html) as my research advisor, I am curently exploring problems at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, specifically to enable **analysis of partial programs** for improving security of software systems.

Prior to joining UTD, I graduated with an *M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence* from the University of Georgia, and a *B.Tech. degree in Computer Science* from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Vadodara. Through my academic journey, I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of/with wonderful people and researchers in:
