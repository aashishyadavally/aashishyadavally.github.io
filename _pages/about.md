For starters, my first name is pronounced  /	ɑ:ʃi:ʃ /.

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, working under the guidance of [Dr. Tien N. Nguyen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/research.html). My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering (SE). I explore if/how machine learning models understand program behaviors, particularly focusing on partial program analysis and software security. My work has been recognized with multiple best paper awards, including the **ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award** at FSE 2024, and the **IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper Award** at SANER 2022. 

***\*I am looking for Assistant Professor positions in academia starting Fall 2025\****

Broadly, my research interests can be summarized as follows:
* Large Language Models for Reasoning on Source Code ([ICSE'25](), [FORGE'24](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-forge2024.pdf))
* Artificial Intelligence for Program Analysis ([FSE'24](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-fse2024.pdf), [OOPSLA'24](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-oopsla2024.pdf), [ESEC/FSE'23](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-esecfse2023-(1).pdf), [ICSE'23](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-icse2023-(1).pdf))
* Artificial Intelligence for Software Security ([ICSE'24](), [ESEC/FSE'23](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-esecfse2023-(2).pdf), [ICSE'23](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-icse2023-(2).pdf))
* Source Code Manipulation for Software Engineering Applications ([ASE'22](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-ase2022-(1).pdf), [ASE'22-NIER](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-ase2022-(2).pdf), [SANER'22](https://aashishyadavally.github.io/assets/pdf/pub-saner2022.pdf))
